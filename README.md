I was so tired of adding spotlights as well as pointlights to the characters in each scene in Studio. I decided to make it possible to add lights directly in Chara Maker Mode instead of doing this in Studio. 

I prepared several colors of spotlights and pointlights that were built-in functions in Unity engine, and ported them to HS2/AIS as accessories.

Please check the latest version on the **[Release](https://github.com/Blatke/Chest-Lights/releases)** page.

So, to add them in Chara Maker, just to go to the Accessory panel, and search for "blake", "chest" or "light" in the Chest tab. Add them to your character, and you can adjust their positions and rotations. But you cannot adjust its scale or strength.

You can instead adjust the light colors in Studio by using Graphics mode. Please be note that: 1. You can also adjust the colors in Chara Maker, but it seems not to be saved in chara cards. So you have to adjust them in the scene, and save them in scene cards. It seems still troublesome, but at least to save your time of adjust the light's position and rotation. 2. I don't believe DHH can do the same work.

In addition, in some circumstances, it seems the options of the light accessories on the characters not to show on the Graphics tab, especially in the default scene after the Studio started. You can load a graphic preset to refresh the light, and then you can see the corresponding options. When you put on or put off the light accessories on Status tab, the Graphics tab might not update the light options in time, you can also load a graphic preset to refresh it.
